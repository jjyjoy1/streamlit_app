Leveraging Streamlit, I developed a dynamic application that integrates diverse data resources and streamlines collaboration across various teams. This centralized platform aggregates data from multiple sources, unifying disparate datasets into a single, cohesive process. With an intuitive, interactive interface, stakeholders can easily access, visualize, and analyze real-time information, which significantly enhances data-driven decision-making. By breaking down silos and fostering cross-team collaboration, our solution not only optimizes workflow efficiency but also ensures consistency and accuracy in data processing across the organization.

Two python scripts can run sucessfully without problem, but I can't uploaded input data which contains clinical information. 
Please let me know if you have any questions about this streamlit app.
