I created a user-friendly Streamlit application that integrates with the bcl2fastq bioinformatics tool. This app will allow you to:

Select an NGS data folder - Input the path to your BCL files
Choose an output location for the demultiplexed FASTQ files
Upload or paste a sample sheet - The app supports both file upload and direct text input
Validate the sample sheet - The app checks for required sections, columns, and common errors
Submit and monitor demultiplexing jobs - Run bcl2fastq with the selected parameters
